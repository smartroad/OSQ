OpenSource Quadcopter 450mm
---------------------------

The OpenSource Quadcopter is my first quadcoper frame design. This is based on a 'H' shape frame so that there is plenty of room for the electronics and equipment to be carried. It has been designed with FPV in mind and has mounting areas for a GoPro, as well as space for autopilots (the APM2.6 for example). To make it easier to store and transport the arms are designed to fold back without the need for tools.
